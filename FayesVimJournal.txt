### Tue 01/29/2019 

Today I'm back at school. We first did our Haiku. I didn't know what a Haiku was
but Zayne told me about it. I got it approved, finished, and right now it's
colored. After that it was group time. The remaining people (including me) just did
nothing. Well, it felt like nothing. After that it was recess. And I played
State Tag. Back at class and at Math Time it was like the same thing expect I
didn't know much. But at Lunch I got Cheese Sticks. At recess I did the same
thing as last recess. At Science we finished a paragraph about rocks. Back at
class we did our Grammar test, reviewed our Book Report page, packed up, stacked
up, people left, but Soham and I stayed. We got what we missed. And then Maxine
and I went home. At home I went to the computer and stayed there. I did my
homework and finished it but I mainly never went off the computer. Mom, Dad and
Andrew came home. I guess that's all for today.
    
Monday sick day
Weekend normal weekend

Fri 01/25/2019 
--------------
Today I'm not at school today, I'm sick. It's just your average sick day. That's
it.

Today in the morning I stole Mom's phone and watched videos on it. But soon at
about 11:00 AM we all got ready and left the house. We first went to Goodwill,
but there was nothing there. Next we went to Deylah's house, and nobody was
home. We soon went to the Thailand Supermarket. We got some food, snacks, and
drinks over there. Our last place was the other Goodwill. Andrew and I got some
items as clothes, tennis net, pink water bottle, and finally Hand Sanitizer.
When we came home Mom made 'soup' for the white noodle. Soon we all went to
sleep (don't worry we finished the 'soup') . When I woke up and everybody else
woke up we ate the white noodle and right now I'm finishing my ME project and
doing what else I need. That's all for today!

On Sunday we just chilled until Mom and Dad came home. That's basically it.

On Saturday it was like the same thing, except Mom and Dad left. That's
basically it.

Sat 01/19/2019
--------------
On Friday we did our normal things, and soon at 9 AM we went to the Rock Our
House Assembly. I was in black and so I went to the Black 'house'. We first sang
our house songs. Then some teachers did their 'speeches'. We also did a mini
game with students, then, the tickets and points. Soon we went back and review
our math test. At recess I just wandered around the blacktop. Back at class we
continue reviewing and then we did the math test. Soon some people were finished
but we had to go to lunch. At lunch I got Fish Sticks than Turkey Sandwich. At
recess we played State tag. Back at class we reviewed our test again, and soon
we moved the Skills test to Tuesday. We then did our ME Project, and then pack
up, clean up, and stack up. We also said Goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich. At home we
just chilled there for awhile. Mom and Dad came home but left to see Auntie
Lisa at the hospital. Andrew, Maxine, and I all went to sleep soon. That's all
for this entry.

Thursday is like Friday, but no assembly, different lunch choice (I choose hot
dog), Science, and yeah that's it. For home, still the same expect Mom and us
went to Goodwill.

Wed 01/16/2019 
--------------
Today at school in class we had Mr. Dier as our substitute. We first did our
usual morning routine, but really long. By the time we were done, it was already
9 AM! We reread Spiders probably the 4th time and soon it was Groups.  People
left and we split up into groups. I was with Anthony G and Gavin M. After
completing it I read Your Turn page 83-84 and wrote answers on page 85. During
this it was Rainy Day recess (Rainy Day recesses you just draw and play board
games) I finished the pages on Your Turn and drew during this recess. At math we
did the past problems on past lessons. And after that it was lunch. At lunch and
for lunch I got ' Breakfast for Lunch' than 'Bean Cheese Burrito' nor 'BQQ
Chicken.' Soon we went back to class for Rainy Day Recess. I drew again, but
this whole time. When Mr. Dier came back, we went to the library. This time,
Mrs. Schulz class came and Mrs. Heller told us different. She told us about
internet safety, news about her husband's co-worker's son being missing and
being 16 years old. After that we checked out and read and then leave. Back at
class we did our ME project and then we packed up, cleaned up, stacked up, get a
treat, and said Goodbye to Mr. Dier. Back at home I ate rice and eggs made by
Andrew. Then Maxine and I chilled in Andrew's room for awhile. We basically did
nothing.  Then we went out of his room and took turns on the iPhone. Mom came
home and called somebody on her phone. Dad also came home and brought chicken
nuggets.  Right now I'm writing this latest entry, that's all for this day!

On Tuesday is almost the same as Wednesday, expect:
Tuesday is Science, no Library, started ME project, no substitute, different
lunch choice and I choose Pepperoni Pizza and that's all for this entry.

On Monday is the same but instead:
Early Dismissal, Different lunch choice and I chose chicken nuggets, different
kind of math lesson: Math Patterns/terms and Prime/Composite numbers, and I
guess that's it for this entry.

On Sunday Andrew, Maxine, Mom, and I woke up and went shopping. We first went to
Goodwill. We sit at the chairs, got some clothes, and went to Costco. Andrew,
Maxine and I separate with Mom to get snacks, and Mom gets the groceries. We got
hot dogs, soda, latte (we also forgot to get things for Dad) and went to the car
for some more shopping. Andrew went to Goodwill near the 99 Cents store. We went
to the 99 Cents store and got some more foods (and snacks :D). Then we came
home. After a few minutes later, Dad and I did the Vim Project to see how many
days is the person is. Then, I guess that's it. Yup, that's all for this Sunday
Entry!

Sun 01/13/2019 
--------------
On Saturday I got up, we cleaned the house. For awhile I worked on my 2019
project, but soon I continued cleaning with Maxine and Andrew. Then Mom called
me to help her wash the dishes by rinsing. After that she cooked beef and
veggies then she went to sleep with Dad. During the 2 hours I listened to music
and looked up on art. Soon Dad woke up and we did a new lesson: How many
seconds the person is. The first time we test the program it was off since I
forgot the leap years. Dad taught me what a leap year is and we did some changes
to the Vim project. Soon we did one extra lesson, but the next extra lesson I
quit. I soon slept with Mom, to wake up and Mom waking up too. Again she cooked
and then I listen to music again, but going back to back to sleep. And that's
all for Saturday. 

Fri 01/11/2019 
--------------
Today we first did math on our whiteboards. We checked our practice, and did our
things. We practice our math lesson yesterday, and put away our whiteboards.
During grammar and reading our Spider pages we had to do a Torando drill. After
that we went through our day normally. We get ready for math, then go to recess.
At recess I played State Tag with my friends. Back at class we learned a new
thing: Multiples. They're like skip counting. We did a page and on the
whiteboard. We got 3 minutes of Drawing time. After that we had to go to lunch.
At lunch I got fish sticks and chips. At recess we repeated what we did expect
we had more people. At class again we finished our math and after a lot of
things we packed up, stacked up, and said goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich. Back at home
I did some things but I slept. After awhile Mom came home. She got us soda and a
roll cake. Soon she went to sleep. I played Scratch and that's all for today!

Thu 01/10/2019 
--------------
Today at school we first did the same schedule expect we did Grammar. We learned
about irregular plural nouns and how they do break the plural rules. For
example, a irregular plural noun would change a letter in the singular noun like
men changed it's middle letter from man, the singular letter. And then we did
P.E, which was again, the usual. I'm not going to even tell what happen at P.E.
Anyways, back at class, Mrs. Emmerich gave instructions on the next step at our
News Year Resolution: Cutting the paper for each section. After a few minutes
the class and I went to recess. There I played softball(?) and then wondered
around. Back at class we contiuned what we did for 15 minutes and then did some
math. We learned about prime (a number that has only 2 factors) and comp (a
number that has multiple factors). During that we had to go to lunch. I got
chicken orange bowl. At recess, again, I wondered around. After recess we went
to science. We did some science things and came back to class. We contiuned math
and did our planner. We packed up, stacked up, and said goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich
before leaving school. Back at home we didn't do much. We did our own thing. I
drew, Maxine was on her phone, and Andrew was doing things. Soon Mom came home,
then Dad. After awhile, I just this just today!

On Wed the 9th, it was like the same thing as Thursday, expect different lunch
choice, no P.E and Science. Different recess actions, no grammar, and that's it!

On Tues it was also the same like Thurs, but no grammar, no P.E, different
recess actions, and that's it.

On Monday we just lounged around until Mom came home and we went to Starbucks,
Goodwill, and Target. At Target I found a Kirby plushie. Back at home I just
lounged around again and slept.

On Sunday it was like the same as Monday expect we didn't went much.

Saturday the 5th the whole family came! We ate, played games, and much more! We
even took a picture of 2018's Christmas! Soon we had to go, but that was okay
since we got McDonalds! And soon I slept. That's all for this entry!

On Friday the 4th, we did the same thing as Mecred's week.

Thu 01/03/2019

Today we woke up and got on our devices. Soon everybody woke up and Aunt Tha had
to go to get McDonalds since the deal last night. Dallas came with her. She soon
came back with the McDonalds. Then Aunt Tha went to work. During that, we played
on our devices but soon I went to sleep. I woke up and went to play on my IPad.
Soon it was low battery again. I then played Roblox, and got kicked out of the
app. So I watched Youtube. Then Aunt Tha came home. Dallas, Daisy, and Deylah
then helped her wrap presents. Right now I'm typing this entry and that's all

Deylah's house! We got Dillyn and drove to the Flea Market. We got some mangos,
a churro, lemonade drinks, and then we drove to Merced. We saw Deylah, Dallas,

Today was (again) the Hmong New Year! Expect we have Grandma and we are going to
the Mercerd this time! After 2 boring hours and walking for awhile, my stomach
started to hurt. I got a churro and we met Grandma from Mercerd. After going we
went to get some pork and sticky rice. Soon we went to see Hmong dances. We also
met Grandpa (from Mercerd too), and he was a VIP/Judge. After leaving the room
we wandered around and then we went back to Grandma's house in Mercerd.  Our
family went to the restroom and we came in the car and went to drive home.
During when I was sleeping, I woke up and we were in the South Area. We got Yaw
and Garlic Bread. Then we continued going home with Dad driving this time. Back
at home I did my Vim and during a few times I looked at Scratch a bit. Right now
Maxine and I are going to play Splatoon 2. That's all for today!

Sat 12/22/2018 
--------------
In the morning when Mom left, we did a Vim lesson. During the Vim lesson I cried
and cried, but it was done and I ate my same thing: rice and chicken soup. After
finishing it and Maxine using her internet plus doing her Vim lesson also, I did
and did it again, until I got my internet time. During the 2nd lesson Mom came
home, and after getting my internet Dad left. Dad came back and then I ate
salmon.  Soon Mom and Grandma left to see relatives. While that we played
Splatoon 2 and I played Pocket Camp on Andrew's phone. Soon I did my Vim lesson
again and Dad left. Right now I'm sitting here righting my journal and that's
all for today!

Fri 12/21/2018 
--------------
In the morning Mom left and while Dad got ready for work he told me he would
give me 30 minutes in the morning, 30 at lunch and 30 when he comes home. He
gave me the first 30 minutes and when he left I use my 30 minutes. After using
my 30 minutes I used 15 minutes of Youtube.  Then I went on Scratch for about 30
minutes. I took a break because I wanted to eat. I ate the same thing as
yesterday's morning. Andrew also woke up at the time. After finishing eating I
continued what I did on the computer. After playing and cheating on different
games/projects, Andrew called me and we sat and did the same thing yesterday's
afternoon (go in his room and talked and chilled). Then Mom came home. She got
Christmas gifts from her friends. She soon said she was going to sleep. And then
we repeated what we did a few hours ago. Soon we went out and Dad came home. I
then did my journal at the last minute when I was looking up stuff. Dad told me
that he would give me 30 minutes once and when I did my journal 30 minutes.
Meanwhile doing this entry I searched up on genes, wikies, and other stuff. I
also went out and went to Maxine and Andrew on his phone.  That's all I think
for today!

Thu 12/20/2018 
--------------
In the morning after Mom and Dad left, I ate some chicken soup and
rice (just chicken soup, no chicken or tofu) since Grandma heated up
the pot. After that I played my 15 minutes of Roblox and watched 15
minutes of Youtube with Maxine. Then I did some other stuff on the
computer: Scratch, Translator, Devainart. Soon Maxine came and did 30
minutes on JavaScript and I did 1 hour and 30 minutes of JavaScript.
Then Andrew, Maxine and I went to chill in Andrew's room. We just talk
there. Soon Dad came with chicken. He also gave me 30 minutes since my
1 hour and 30 minutes without my journal. Soon he left and I stayed
and continued my computer things until Andrew said that Maxine and him
were going to sleep. I brushed my teeth, plus washing my hands we went
into Maxine's 'rent' room. I was going to sleep there. After 2 or 3
hours I woke up first. Maxine woke up too and I went into the living
room with Grandma until Mom came home. She got Mexico gum from her
friend. We stole her phone until she called us for the phone. After
that Dad came and they talked for awhile. I toke Mom's phone and soon
we watched videos on it. Then Dad came and took it back for Mom. Then
I got bored and stayed in the room. Soon I came out and stayed in the
living room. That's all for today! 

Wed 12/19/2018 
--------------
In the morning we went to science class. There we learned about rock
scratching. Rock scratching is used to find how hard it is. We scratch
the minerals we used last time. And when we came back to class, we did
NOT unpack, because we were going to clean the class! After cleaning
10% we got our math quizzes (that were about equations and graph bars)
and saw our results. I was one of the skilled kids that got 100%
correct. The other kids (Expect the other skilled kids) corrected
their mistakes. After that we read our Christmas tales. We finished
one of them, and we did the next tale: The Winged Wonder. Later during
recess I went to the blacktop walls and stood there like a stick. Back
at class we colored in a 'poinsettia'. During that time Mrs. Emmerich
continued reading us the second tale: The Winged Wonder. It was about
a boy named Theo who had deformed legs, he had to live with his Aunt
and Uncle, later in the tale he came to a house where a rich lady
lived. She showed him the bird cage, but we had to stop there. At
lunch I chose Breakfast for lunch instead BBQ chicken. At recess I did
the same thing as last recess. In class we watched 2 movies that were
about Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman. During
the movies we got hot chocolate with whipped cream and marsh mellows.
Also there were 2 spills of hot chocolate during the movies. I also
colored and watched between. After awhile we cleaned up our desks,
packed up, finished up our tale, got our candy canes, said goodbye to
Mrs. Emmerich, and left school. Back at home I just slept and woke up
doing Google Translate to find out what some Russian people said
during school. Then I did my journal and Dad gave me some tips about
Vim at the last minute, and that was my day! Extra: Mom is probably
coming home with Grandma, We'll greet Grandma, Maxine and I steal
Mom's phone since Mom and Dad are talking to Grandma (or 'ask' for
it). And that's it!

Tue 12/18/2018 
--------------
Today in the morning we went to the Multi Room for our performace (yes, it's
our day today). We sang all our songs, stayed for pictures, retry on It's a
Small World since we messed it up, and went back to class! In class we
worked on our stockings (I was almost finished), and at recess I played with
Katelyn and Harkiniat. Back at class I finished my stockings and made my
poinsettia ornament. When I was about to get some glitter, it was time for
lunch. At lunch I chose beef taco over pepperoni pizza or cheese pizza.  And
at recess I walked around with Harkiniat talking to me and me talking to
her.  We were supposed to go to science, but Mrs. Emmerich offered to give
Mrs. Schulz to have a chance rest while her class went to science. We then
continued working on our projects. I finished both of them and colored in a
Christmas paper. Then we went to the library since we were going to science
class first thing (no unpacking) tomorrow. There she read us a special
story, then I read after that. Back at class we did our planner, packed up,
stacked up, and said Goodbye to Mrs.  Emmerich and left school. At home
about 10 minutes later I went to sleep. When I woke up I had a temper
tantrum. I said I didn't want to go to my performace, but I did anyways.
After that we came home and I had my dinner, ate funnel cake, and that was
my day!

Mon 12/17/2018 
--------------
In the morning (after unpacking), we went straight to the Multi Room.
There we practiced the show. We did all songs, and then we had to go
back to class. In class we read for awhile, then watched Mystery Doug,
and did our math test. I plugged in the equations, answered the
questions, and I was sure I'd pass (if I did not pass, I'd say that
        was waisting my work). Soon it was recess. At recess I sticked around
at the blacktop walls (I usually call them 'Walls of Warmth'). After
recess I checked my answers, and then the Paper passers and Class
Managers got our tests and our blockers. Next was our stockings. I
thought that I'd do some stuff to my stockings. Soon it was lunch. At
lunch I got chicken nuggets. At recess I again did the same thing as
last recess. Back in class we mini-cleanup. And did our usual stuff.
We walked outside and did the whole show again. We said goodbye, and
left school. At home I just ate a few snacks, sleep, Mom came home, I
woke up (Maxine too), We tried out clothes, and then we did other
stuff. So that was my day!

Sun 12/16/2018

Today in the morning we got our chicken and left Mercerd. We stopped
at Mom's friend house and got her cream, next Delyah's house to drop
off Uncle Bay (Yes he came with us), and went home. Mom went to sleep
and we did our javascript. Soon Andrew and I went to the cats and get
the mail. Soon Andrew and Dad left for driving practice. This my stop
for now. That's all! Stop 1, Continue 1: After awhile I did some stuff
on the computer, but soon Mom called me to wash the dishes. While
washing the dishes, Mom asked me if Maxine was asleep. I said she was.
(But she was awake) Then Andrew and Dad came back. Soon we went into
our room and did some art (mostly me), then we all went to sleep!
That's all for today!

Sat 12/15/2018 
------------
In the morning we played Breath of the Wild, but we were interrupted
by Mom and had to go to Mercerd. In the car we stopped to the Asian
store to get bread and jello (some things too) to eat during our trip.
After that stop we waited about 1 hour and 30 minutes to get there. We
were stuck so we called some people and then after about 10 minutes
Uncle Yee came with his girlfriend. In the house we played Bazoo! It
was about people turns to guess and hinters that cannot say the word.
Maxine and Uncle Yee won... Anyways they left and we were alone for
about 2 hours. Soon Auntie Tha came and we went to Target. We only got
Pokemon Cards for Maxine. At Walmart we got my Ugly Christmas sweater
and McDonalds. Back at Grandma's house I ate rice with chicken
nuggets. Soon Grandma and Grandpa came. They talked with Mom while we
watched videos. Then we went to sleep. That's all for today!

left, the remained ones read their own books. After awhile we went to
P.E. At P.E we reran our Laps Test. I finished! Then Max and Nina had
to go. In class we watched the broadcast and Mystery Doug! Soon we had
to go to recess. At recess I wandered around the playground. Back at
class we did our math again, but about comparison bars and what we
would compare. We learned some words that hinted us that it was
Multiplication Comparing or Addition Comparing. I was one of the ones
that got my homework right, so I helped people. Then we did the next
one on our own, and I got both of them right! Soon it was lunch. At
lunch I got Orange Chicken. At recess I played with Billy. It was a
fun time! After that it was science. We did our test and when we
finished, we did our brochure. Then we went back to class and did our
planner, did our new matt for people that are sick, packed up, read
Island of the Blue Dolphins, stacked up, and said goodbye to Mrs.
Emmerich. At home I ate chicken and rice. Soon Aunt Lesa came to stop
by. After about 1 hour she left, and 1 hour later Dad came home. I did
my homework and now I'm doing my journal! That is all for today!

Wed 12/12/2018

Today at groups we reviewed our pages and after Max and Nina left we
read our 3 Chapter Stories and did our questions. My group only
finished two. At recess I read at the Walls on the Blacktop. Back at
class we did our math. We learned about compare bars of adding and
subtraction. We were stuck on a problem but we had to go to lunch. At
lunch I got chicken patty, and at recess I played DOS. I almost won
but it canceled. When we came back we got our books and went to the
library. There Mrs. Heller read How the Grinch Stole Christmas. After
that everybody went to read, re-new, check out, and more. I just read
and read and read. After that we also checked our test and went to
perform. We practiced dancing, singing, acting, and other. Back at
class we did our math equation, did planner, packed up, stacked up,
and said goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich. I stayed at school since Mr. Dier
was here. After getting something from him Maxine and I went home.
Back at home I did some stuff on the computer, watched Andrew, and

and then Auntie Ker came! We went to the mall and stopped to get
chicken nuggets for me. Soon she left and that was my day!

Tue 12/11/2018 
--------------
In the morning at groups we got out our Your Turn book and did two
pages: the first was vocab, and the other one was about Key Details
and Main Idea. I finished both of them and read until it was time to
share our ideas with partners. And after that my class went to recess.
There I just wandered around the blacktop. Back at class we did math.
We learned some hard things. They were about equations and compare
bars. Soon we went to lunch and at lunch I got chicken nuggets. After
eating everyone went to recess. At recess I played DOS. Then after
recess we went to science. At science I learned about real minerals
and after that we all got to share which mineral (1,2,3,4) we were
thinking about. Then we went to class again and continued math. After
that we read Island of the Blue Dolphins and did our work on Wonders
Wheel. Soon we packed up, stacked up, and I stayed at school for a
snowball. Plus, I got a new book. After school and at home I did some
stuff on the computer. When Dad came home he made me ramen and ate
his lunch. After him leaving Mom came home and went to Goodwill. After
Goodwill we went to McDonalds and came home. After awhile we all went

Today we had a substitute. I forgot her name but we went to the
Multi-Room for our performance practice, but after the first song a
fire alarm happen! After wasting a few minutes from the fire alarm we
went back and retried our performance.  We had some small failures,
but in the end we did pretty good. Soon we went to PE for our running
laps. I finished about in 1 minutes and 30 seconds. After that we went
back to class and then to recess. At recess I talked to Katelyn at
the playground. Back at class we reviewed our homework and then did
our quiz/test. I finished it and I think I got most of them accurate.
Then it was lunch. For lunch I got corn dog. At recess I played UNO

Today's Maxine birthday! In the morning Mom made eggrolls for Maxine's
birthday, and we then played Breath of the Wild! We got some stuff
(from a guy), rode on a Skalhorse, went to 2 shrines (one was located
        in a maze), paid our house, found a lab and finally found the blue
flame! We then played Super Smash Bros Ultimate, and then Uncle Cha
came! He played with us too but shortly Delyah, Daisy, Dallas, and
Uncle Mong came! I ate a eggroll and took a break from the game. Soon
Delyah and I joined. We did 5 players. I teamed up with Uncle Cha,
Andrew with CPU, and finally Maxine with Delyah. Uncle Cha and I were
on a streak, until Andrew finally ruined it. Soon after 2 hours,
Dallas and Daisy had to go. We said goodbye to them and then continued
our few last moments on Classic Mood. We played as Ice Climbers. Our
final boss was Master Hand and Crazy Hand. After that we played a few
minutes on Roblox. Then after Delyah leaving, I continued Roblox for
30 minutes. Soon I stopped playing and now I'm doing my journal.

Fri 12/07/2018 
--------------
In the morning we went to the Multi-room. There we sang all the
performance songs. When it was our turn, we did quite good (and so the
        other classes). When it was the 'I have a Little Dreidel', we needed
to improve on that song, and when it was 'We Wish You a Merry
Christmas', we did good. After leaving, we flipped our SAB (Student
        Activity Book) to page 141, then we lined up for recess. During
recess I wandered around on the Blacktop. After recess, lining up for
class, and going to class, we did our math. We first corrected our
math, and then we reviewed a lesson but it was multiplying and
dividing instead. We did 2 multiplication and division families, then
we reviewed another lesson. Then we put away our math and did our
planners. Soon it was lunch. At lunch I got fish sticks (yum!), and
today was free seating. Free seating is where you get to sit on any
lunch table in the cafeteria. But after about 10 minutes, Mrs. Net
said that we were going to not have free seating next week because of
our bad behavior and 3 Streak free seating. At recess I again wandered
around the blacktop. After lunch recess we went into the multi-room,
where we practiced our song: 'Rocking Around the Christmas Tree'. We
practiced our Orange Justice on "Deck the halls with boughs of
holly", since we were having trouble on it. We also changed how we
danced: 'Walk 8 times, floss 8 times, running man 4 times, jelly 4
times, Walk back 8 times". Yeah, Mrs Emmerich was creative with her
math. We lined back to class and back at class we read our new story:
'Buffalo is Back." It was about buffalo, land, and people. First the
Native Americans cared for the buffalo, people killed the buffalo,
people then fought for the grass, the grass and crops died, people
died, survivors went away, people find buffalo, but one found 300 of
them, then people learned how to farm curves, found 'extinct' plants,
and that was the end! Then we went back to the multi-room and
practiced our song again. We practiced some of the flaws we had last
time. After 30 minutes, we went back to class. At class we packed up
and read Island of the Blue Dolphin. We did 1 chapter and a few
pages. Then we stacked up and said goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich, and
after saying goodbye, I went to the library and got a new book. Soon
we left school and went home. At home we spent about 3 hours staying
home without Andrew (Since he went with Dad and Mom went to work). At
about 5 PM they came back, following with Mom coming home with fish.
We then ate and after a few minutes I washed the dishes with Mom.
Soon Andrew did his Vim and now I am doing my journal! That was my
day!

--------------
In the morning we read our new story about the Ocean Life. We first
read with our groups, but then we had to read on our own since people
were loud and were off task. After reading twice, we took some notes
about the genre we read: "Narrative Non-Fiction". Then at groups we
went to P.E. We just did laps. I finished my 3 Laps. After coming back
from P.E, we presented our Act III. There were many different kinds of
stories. We told people compliments, and more. Soon we prepared for
math. Then it was recess. There at recess I played Line Tag and after
recess we did math. We learned two more things in math: Solution and
Situation equations. The Situation Equation tell us the information in
the problem and the Solution Equation tells us the answer of the
problem. We did two problems with these two. One of the equations we
had to stop for lunch. And so at lunch it was free seating. I got my
beef hot-dog. At recess I just did the same: Race and Line-Tag. Back
at class we continued the problem. After finishing it we finished our
Genre page and did our grammar. We learned about plural and singular
nouns. Singular and Plural were really familiar from 2nd and 3rd
grade. Soon we packed up, stacked up, and everyone else said goodbye.
I stayed after school for snowballs. I got 3 Snowballs, and I returned
my book. So we left school after that. At home I ate 1 cupcake, did
some stuff on the computer, stayed in our room with our phone, Mom
came home, we watched the Game Awards, Dad came home, Maxine got Gacha
Life, and that was my day!

Wed 12/05/2018 
--------------
At school I read at the library. But for only a few minutes. At groups
in class my group and I were almost done so we blew the trumpets
(Which were multi-colored). But for awhile we went back to read. At
recess I played on the playground (again). Back at class we did math.
I did a high-level equal equation. And then we did a not-equal
equation. Also we again made 8 different ways. At lunch I got
Breakfast for lunch. At recess I played DOS for one round, then I
played the playground (again...). After that we performed. We didn't
do too well (We did bad in my opinion). Back at class we did our
planner, got our books, and went to the Library. There at the library
Mrs. Heller read a book and then we read. Another 4th Grade class
flood in, but we went out in time. There back at class we read awhile,
but then we packed up, stacked up, and said Goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich.
At home I ate my funnel cake and slept for 2 hours. When I woke up
Mom came home with Maxine's Andrew talked to I about Gachaverse, but we had to go to Goodwill. There
for 30 minutes we shopped. Then we went home and I ate funnel cake
with a piece of churros. Mom made jello and Maxine did her journal,
while I did my homework. Now it's 10:12 PM and that is my day!

Tue 12/04/2018 
--------------
In the morning we reread our stories for the Skills Test (I couldn't
        go to the library since it was closed) . My grade was 100% (And about
            5 students also got the same) and at Groups Time, we printed our
        writing and got on our drawing. We were on Ant when time was up. At
        recess I played DOS (Yes the host has finally finally figured that
                it's kind of like UNO). Back at class we did math. Then it
        was lunch. I got pepperoni pizza. At recess I played DOS. After that
        we went to science. We did mock rock reviews. Back at class we packed
        up, stacked up ,and said goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich. So then we left
        school. Actually, before we went home, Maxine talked to her friends.
        After about wasting 5 minutes, we went home. At home we took a 3 hour
        break, and when Mom came home, Maxine and I washed the dishes. Soon we
        played the Switch and went to sleep then. That was my day!

        Mon 12/03/2018 
        --------------
        In the morning we sang I Have a Little Dreidel, It's a Small World,
        and We Wish You a Merry Christmas. We also practiced our routine songs
        with singers' locations. After a long period of time we went back to
        class and watched Mystery Doug. The question this week was Why is the
        Mars Red? The answer was that Mars is made of iron, and water helps
        the iron rust faster. The real answer was unknown but there was a
        bonus about robots. One was 'Flying Robots', 'Dog Robots', 'Human
        Robots', 'Hand Robots', and 'Swimming Robots'! We also went to the
        library too during the video. After the video we reread The Princess
        Frog. We did the Theme + Your Turn Questions. Soon we went to recess.
        There I just played on the playground. Soon I lined up with my class.
        At math we did a new lesson. It was Unit 4, so we learned some new
        stuff (Some was from 3rd Grade) and we were almost finished but it was
        Lunch Time already. At lunch I got chicken nuggets. At recess I played
        DOS (It was bad), but later I played UNO. I lost AGAIN (Will I ever
                win?). Back at class we continued math, did our planner, went to
        practice places, and left School. Back at home I just did the Lazy
        Life. But at about 3 PM we washed the dishes, 5 PM I did my homework,
        and now it's almost 7 PM and I'm doing my journal today. That's all
        for today!

        Sun 12/02/2018 
        --------------
        This morning Mom cooked fish and pork, Maxine almost ate all the pork.
        Mom said that Delyah and her family were doing a BQQ. Mom, Maxine,
        Andrew, and I only went since Dad and Mom argued if we were going or
        not, but we did anyway. When we got there, Dillyn was the only one
        that noticed us. We were greeted with Dallas, and Daisy. We were also
        greeted with Uncle Yee, Uncle Cha, and Uncle Moua. Mom and Andrew went
        to the Asian Market and while we were there we did golf, ate steak and
        rice (Yum), and most of the time I stayed inside. Andrew and Mom came
        back.  Soon Mom went to the Asian Market again. Then Delyah (Dillyn, Daisy, Dallas) 'cousins' came. I don't know their names (And they
                don't know ours), while they were there, we did some games and gun
        shooting (Nerf gun don't worry). At some point we had to go inside.
        There we played Barbies (I only played on the phone. After a few
                minutes (about 10) Delyah came back. There we played War (Math
                    Version). Delyah won. And then we tried to play spoons but failed.
                Soon Mom came, we did a mini draw competition, but then we had to
                leave. We said goodbye to them and went to Goodwill. There we couldn't
                find my Christmas sweater, but we did find a lot of other things. We
                went to a second Goodwill, and found some Christmas sweaters but they
                were too big. All we got is a pair of shoes. We came home and Maxine
                did her homework (Andrew helped her). Dad came home and asked did we
                do our journal. We both said no.  And that is why I'm doing this entry
                right now. That's all for today!

                Sat 12/01/2018 
                --------------
                Today I was the first one to wake up early. I watched a lot of videos
                (Including Splatoon Videos), but then everyone else woke up. Andrew,
                Maxine, and I played Breath of the Wild. We did two shrines, saw a
                dragon, and went to the jungle. We stopped there, since time went out.
                And next we kinda just did our own thing. But later Mom said that we
                were going to Golden Corral. I took a bath, did my Friday Entry at the
                minute, and we went. There I ate so little, I mainly ate all the steak
        though. And for dessert we ate ice cream and cotton candy. Then we
        went home and I did my Javascript. When I was done I went to sleep.
        When I woke up, Mom and Andrew said that they were going to Goodwill,
        and they left. There I just looked up some stuff until they came
        back. And they did! I think that's all for today, expect we made
        jello. I hope you enjoy Saturday's entry!

        Fri 12/01/2018 
        --------------
        This Friday morning we got a new paper for our songs. It was called 'I
        have a little dreidel'. We also performed the songs we already planned
        for. Then we assembled places for our show. We also took turns for it.
        After that we went back to class. We went to recess next. There I
        played on the playground with my friends. (Katelyn, Eliana, etc.) And
        after recess we did the test. We reviewed the questions 1 by 1. Then
        we did it. I was halfway done when we did the GoNoodle. And then we
        continued. I was almost done when we stopped for lunch. So we went
        there. Today was the Tailgate Party. We had chips, hot dogs, desserts,
        sodas, and more. I was done and I saved a brownie for my sister (she
                shared with her friends), then I played UNO again with 5th graders. I
        lost... but anyway when we lined up, I saw Mom! So back in class we
        continued and I was done in 7 minutes! I read for the rest of the
        test, but it didn't last long. When time was up, we did the dance
        moves in order to be great. The first one was the Floss, next Running
        Man, Jelly, and finally Egyptian. Then we had to line up to assemble
        and sing our song (which is the 5th song). We also changed some moves
        (still, pony dance for 'Everyone dancing', etc.) When we came back, we
        read for the snowballs. Only one person finished a book and got
        snowballs and that was Darina. We packed up, cleaned up (a lot), and
        finally packed up. We said goodbye to Mrs Emmerich and that was my
        day!

        Thu 11/29/2018 
        --------------
             At groups in the morning we contiuned our Scene III. My group and I
             finished but we added some little touches. Then at recess I just
             drawed while a movie played. Then at math we contiuned our Unit Test
             review. We were almost done but we weren't finished. Aw man! Next was
             lunch. I had pizza. I just ate the apple instead though. At recess the
             movie contiuned playing and I just kept drawing. There were also times
             that I watched the movie. After that we went to Science. There we
             drew two events and wrote two properties about the viles. After
             shaking it was milky with bubbles and material settled down. After
             settling it was yellow water, 3 layers: flower, sands, and the pink
             stuff. We also reviewed about Mock Rocks. Then it was time to go. Back
             at class we finished our page, did our planner, and praticed our
             song: Rocking Around the Christmas Tree. We did good out there! And
             then we packed up and stacked up, stay goodbye to Mrs Emmerich. Next,
             I got my new library book (I finished the old one) and went back home
             with Maxine. At home I just ate 2 candies also watching videos (like
                     Wed's entry). But then Andrew woke up and he cooked some chicken.
             After doing some Javascript and a few minutes of the 3DS, we ate the
             chicken. Since the chicken was too spicy for me, Andrew made me eggs.
             I ate my dinner and now I'm typing my journal, which I'm doing right
             now. And that was my day!

             Wed 11/28/2018 
             --------------
             In the morning when we did Groups we did a Doc of Scene 3 for our new
             story: The Ant and the Grasshopper. 2 groups were on the right track:
             my group and another group. Everyone else had a story. At recess I
             walked around (I played with my friends for awhile). Back at class we
             reviewed our homework and then did some pages of the Unit Test. We
             only had a few pages until we went to lunch. I got chicken since there
             was no Chicken Patty Sandwiches left. At lunch I played state tag with
             my friends. After that we went to the Library (yes it's library day).
             There I read and read and read. Back there we did our planner. We
             went to the Mutli and we set up our spots for our show. Back at class
             we did the normal stuff for our leaving, said goodbye to Mrs.
             And went back home.After school Andrew woke up and it was kind of the lazy life. Then we
             did some stuff on the computer (I did javascript). And Andrew was in
             the kitchen. Finally Maxine was watching videos. Then for awhile we
             went to the park. I met Aiden there since nobody was there. Also, we
             "raced" together. When Mom came home we went to Goodwill (Maxine
                     didn't go with us). There we got a lot of stuff. After that when we
             were near home, Maxine called us and said that she was scared (from a
                     video). When we came home we watched some videos about baking, did
             our journals (which whawt I'm doing right now), and playing board
             games. That's all for today!

             Tue 11/27/2018 
             --------------
             In the morning we went to Multi to do our Christmas Show like Maxine
             last year. There we got in our spots for the show. We also sang 2
             songs: We Wish You a Merry Christmas and It's a Small World. Then we
             went back to class. There students went to Groups and students
             (including me) were leftovers. Mrs. Emmerich was so pleased of our
             behavior (yes we behaved so so well.) that she allowed us to read most
             of the time. After reading about 40 minutes we got on our chromebooks
             for the assignments Mrs. Emmerich told us about. Then we went to
             recess. I had to be on bench because of my homework thing. When we
             came back we had our math test. There was 5 problems. I finished all
             of them and I said that I'll check it. At lunch I got chicken nuggets
             with a apple, goldfish, and a juice box. I sat with my friends at my
             class' table. At recess (indoors) I just drawed at my seat. Since it's
             Tuesday we had to go to science. At science we broke up mock rocks
             and studied it's minerals by water. At class we contiuned our test.
             After that we did our planners. Next we sang + danced to our song. We
             packed up also stacking up. Then we said goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich.
             That was my day!

             On Monday we did the same on Tuesday (Expect the show, science, and
                     lunch choice). So yeah, the only thing that is different is the book
             that Mrs. Heller told me about. So yeah that was it! That was my day!

             sun 11/25/2018
             --------------
             In the morning I played Splatoon 2, and after my turn Maxine was
             next! After that we stopped playing and I played New Leaf until I
             washed the dishes with Mom (She did the rest of the work). And then
             Maxine and I were doing Javascript to go to Barnes and Nobel. We
             didn't get to go there since Dad was getting a new haircut. So we had
             to go with Andrew and Mom instead. We first went to the Asian
             Market. There we got cans, Coconut Milk, and other stuff. Then we went
             to Goodwill. There Mom and Maxine walked together while Andrew and I
             walked around and looked at stuff (we also got some too.). We spent
             about a hour. And finally Winco Foods. We also spent about a hour
             there. Andrew and I walked around and got candy, while Maxine and Mom
             shopped and shopped. When we got home, I ate Yaw and Maxine ate Hot
             Cheetos (we also got candy.). Dad watched his videos and I'm right now
             typing my journal. That's all for this journal entry!

             Sat 11/24/2018 
             --------------
             Today is the most boring day ever! First Andrew slept 2 times, we did
             nothing, and other boring things. Next, we did Javascript for the
             Switch. When we got the internet for the Switch, we updated it. And
             MORE boring stuff! While we waited we played Animal Crossing: New
             Leaf and that. Night time we did Akinator. And then we went to sleep.
             Sorry for it being short since today was boring. That's all for this
             entry!

             Fri 11/23/2018 
             --------------
             In the first thing in the morning we played Legend of Zelda. We tried
             to get our sword in the Korok Forest and we died once, and Plan B
             failed too. So we saved and went to Goodwills. There we found board
             games. At the second one Mom went for clothes and shoes, while Andrew,
             Maxine and I walked around together. After checking out we went into
             the car.We were soaking wet! Next we stopped at In-And-Out because I
             wanted fries. I payed with my own money, so yeah. Actually, Mom PAYED
             it with my own money! Then we went to the 3rd Goodwill. There I pooped
             and Andrew, Maxine and I stayed at the furniture area. Then we went to
             Walmart (since Andrew wanted to). There he got wipes and Luna's food.
             Then we went home, and the next few minutes, nothing happen.
             Soon we played on the Switch. Time ran out and I played New Leaf. And
             then I feed Luna. Next I looked on Fandom. And here I am, typing
             today's entry. I hope you enjoyed!

             Thu 11/22/2018 
             --------------
             After waking up and taking a bath, we played Breath of the Wild. We
             had to go to the Hmong New Year, so we left at 12: 00 PM. It was
             celebrated at Cal Expo and when we arrived we first went to eat (since
                     I was hungry) pork and ribs. Then we walked a whole 'lap' around the
             area. I noticed there weren't many people around since probably the
             rain kinda ruined it. After walking a lap, we ate a BIG funnel cake
             and one icee for Maxine. We walked a part of a lap, then we drive
             home. During the drive home I finished the funnel cake. Then I went to
             sleep when we came home. How long did I sleep? 2 hours I think. We
             went for Black Friday. We started at Best Buy. Did we find anything?
             No. So we went to Walmart, since Andrew told us they had it there.
             There we DID find something: Splatoon 2. That was we looking for at
             Best Buy. After getting the game, we went home. And at home it seems
             like I'm doing my journal. That's all for today!

             On Wednesday morning I played about 10 minutes of Roblox, Delyah and
             them came! We first started off simple, 3DS, computer, Switch, but
             when Andrew started baking we started to be a little crazy! Like not
             the really insane kids that go the mental hospital. They were fighting
             with each other. But we did some Build Battle on Minecraft on Andrew's
             computer. Then we watercolored + Get Luna out. After that we build a
             fort! A room sized fort. We made some posters about it. At 9:42 (I
                     think so), they had to leave. Then we went to sleep. That was all for
             this day!

             On Tuesday Faye Ly forgot about this day. So there is no entry.

             Mon 11/19/2018 
             --------------
             In the morning I was the second to wake up. I played Gachaverse in the
             few first minutes. After everyone got up, Dad left, we watched
             Youtube. Then awhile minutes later, Andrew and I slept. When I woke
             up, I watched Youtube on the iPad, since I had since I sleep. I
             watched for 2 hours, then went to the living room. Andrew woke up, and
             we cooked chicken. I'm writing my journal at this point now, so I'll
             stop here until more! Stop 1.

             Sun 11/18/2018
             --------------
             I played Animal Crossing: New Leaf, and I got a bronze trophy for the
             Fishing Tourament. Andrew and Maxine played Breath of the Wild. They
             stop at the Zora Area, where they saved. Then we did nothing for the
             rest of the time, then Dad took the Switch Joycons. We cleaned a
             little bit, then watercolored, and we went to sleep. I hope you enjoy
             this Weekend Entry!

             In the morning, Today was the fishing tournament for New Leaf, while
             for Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, we uncorrupted a spirit,
             upgraded our abilities, went into shrines, and we saved for the last
             few minutes. Then Mom went to Goodwill for a long time. While she was
             gone, I played the 3Ds (Well, not until Andrew got it), Maxine danced,
             and Andrew did his business. When Mom came home (Which was about 1:00
                     PM.), we went to the bank, then Costco. At Costco we got nuts, and
             some other products. We also got some churros and hot dogs. We got
             some burgers too. At Barnes and Noble, Andrew and Mom went to
             Marshalls, while at Barnes and Noble, Harry Potter event was
             happening. We KIND OF participate it. After that we got a Large
             Vanilla Bean thanks to Dad (Thank you, Dad!). Then Mom and Andrew
             showed up, we went into the car, talked about Jamba Juice, came home,
             relaxed a bit, and typed our journal, which is what I'm doing right
             now. I hope you enjoyed this Weekend Entry!

             Fri 11/16/2018 
             --------------
             Since there was no school today from the bad air condition, we got to
             skip about school and what happen at home. In the morning, we played
             Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. We defeated Ganon! We then ate
             breakfast and cleaned some of the house. I went to sleep after that.
             When I woke up, The house was DANG clean! Then dad came home, I
             pooped, we played overwatch, and I think that was it! I hope you enjoy
             this super super short entry!

             Thu 11/15/2018 
             --------------
             In the morning, we went to 3rd Grade's show, "The Past is a Blast".
             The show had 6 scenes, also with lots of songs in it. It also had
             dances. After the main part of the show, they said there would be a
             night performance at 6:00 PM, we didn't get to go (since it was 6:00
                     PM, duh!) though. Back at class we did 2 indoor recess GoNoodles
             because of PE. And why it wasn't outside? The smoke. After that we
             typed a essay about Thanksgiving. Most of us didn't finish. We shared
             our stories- I mean essays. Most of them are creative. We got ready
             for math. And then recess started! We just watched a movie called
             Chicken Little for recess. We stayed inside of recess because who
             would watch a movie outside when it had terrible smoke conditions?
             When recess was over we reviewed our math problems and learned
             something new: Add 1 more. Yup. Because if there's 9 Remainder 6 we
             should add 1 more. So it would be 10, not just leave as it is. We then
             left for our lunch. At lunch I got Orange Chicken. Yum. Back at class,
             we continued Chicken Little. After recess, we went to Science. We
             learned about our new vocab for science. We had our own mock rocks
             which we studied it. For example, we studied it's mass, depth, and
             more! When we came back we continued math, did our planner and did our
             grammar packet. We did a page and then we packed up and cleaned up.
             Mrs. Emmerich told us that there would be no school tomorrow (No!). We
             said goodbye to her, and that was my day!

             Wed 11/14/2018 
             --------------
             In the morning I was the 3rd one to be in the classroom. We had our
             THEME test, which a lot of us failed. I wasn't one of them, so lucky
             me! Also the person next to me also passed, so I guess you could call
             us the lucky pair? Then we reviewed the answers. At groups, since I
             was one that passed, I did typing club. There were about 6 of us.
             While the rest of the students did THEME with Mrs. Emmerich again. In
             recess, I drew and drew. At math we continued URSC. We learned that
             went to recess, I mostly played games, but I did drawing too. After
             recess, we went to library!  There I just read until we left. We then
             continued math and did planner, and our RA. We got another paper for
             our Christmas show. We packed up, cleaned up, stacked up, said Goodbye
             to Mrs. Emmerich, and that was my day!

             Tue 11/13/2018 
             --------------
             Today had a schedule of a Rainy Day, since the smoke was getting
             worse. I don't know what happen, but we got 4 papers. Our Christmas
             Show lyrics, 2 THEME papers, and a Native Americans Study Guide. We
             did the 2 THEME papers. I choose Respect and Responsibility. For that
             I did RACES. I only manage to get one RACES done. Oh well. At recess,
             we stayed in class for recess. At recess, we drew or do GoNoodle. I
             did Misc. Sadly, recess didn't last long. We did Math, and a new
             lesson we learned was remainders and URSC. We were almost done, but we
             hadn't get to do the C. At lunch, I choose Chicken Nuggets with
             Goldfish. After eating, we went back into the classroom.  This time I
             did puzzles with my classmate, but we didn't get to finish. Oh well!
             We went to science for Geography, a game. We got 500 points! Back at
             class, we did planner, and continued Study Guides.  Then we cleaned up
             and blah blah blah, outside I gave my art to Harkiant I owed to her,
             and went home. That was my day!

             Mon 11/12/2018 
             --------------
             Today, I don't know how to say it. Morning to Noon, Dad and Andrew
             left for driving pratice. At home, Mom, Maxine and I just did nothing.
             We were planning to clean but it was cancled and we did landury
             instead. Dad and Andrew came back to eat. Also, Andrew stayed home and
             Dad left for a customer or something. A few hours later we had to go
             to the bank and get Andrew a bank account, but the bank was closed,
             so, Awww Man! We went to 99 Cents and Goodwill was nearby. But
             Goodwill there didn't have anything so we went to the occsinal
             Goodwill. We found stuff there. We went home, ate dinner, Dad went to
             sleep, we cleaned our room, and here I am, typing this LATE. I hope
             you enjoy this short entry!

             Sat 11/11/2018 
             -------------- 
             Today when Dad left, Mom, Maxine, Andrew, and I first went to get
             Andrew's glasses at Kaisers. There, Andrew got a cool case and some
             extras. We then headed to CitiBank because Mom needed something there.
             I stayed there for a little bit, but then I had to go with Maxine and
             Andrew. We first went to Sprouts for anything we could find. But we
             couldn't find anything! So we went to Five Guys (We really wanted to
                     go there!). There, the fries were squishy, but the rest of it was
             really okay, so if I was able to give a review, I would give it 4
             stars out of 5. When we came out, Mom was done with the conversation
             about the lending money, and we went to TJ. There, we just looked
             around, but we looked at the toys section for something for Evan or
             Gavin, we hadn't found anything yet, so we went to the Hmong
             Supermarket. There we got some stuff, and went to Delyah's house next.
             They weren't there sadly, so we had to go to Goodwill. We found some
             stuff there, and we were able to check out. We came back, and I showed
             some stuff I got at the garage sale yesterday. At dinner, we ate baked
             chicken tenders and rice. We washed the dishes, waited for Dad (He
                     didn't came back yet), ate late dessert. Finally we went to sleep. Now
             you know about today's entry!

             Fri 11/09/2018 
             --------------
             In the morning, when groups was about to start, we went to the Glee
             Club's show. There was songs from different movies/music studios. They
             played The Lion King(No worries), When can I see you again(Owl City),
             A million dreams(Greatest Showman), Ice Age(Chasing the Sun), Pokemon
             Theme Song(Pokemon Red and Blue), and that was it! When we came back
             to class and people went for groups, we did dances for our Christmas
             show. After showing a few dances, we got ready for math, and went to
             recess. At recess, I played at the playground. In math, we did
             rounding quotients/dividends. We put the data in our notebooks, and
             Mrs. Emmerich told us we would have to give it to our parents in order
             to know it. At lunch, I choose Fish Sticks, but I had to get Turkey
             Sandwich since they ran out. At recess, I played UNO, but with more
             people. I lost, again. I just hate that!! In class(again) we had to do
             one more problem about rounding, and then we did the Toolbox
             Lesson with our new School Counciler, and then we packed up, cleaned
             up, and did our garage sale. I didn't get to spend ALL my money, but
             it was so close!! We said goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich and that was our
             day!

             Thu 11/08/2018 
             --------------
             In the morning I did the usual: Library. I was almost done with the
             book, but since time was swift, I had to finish in the classroom! And
             in the classroom we did a RA page for our Skills Test about THEME. At
             groups we went to PE! There at PE we swtiched our games. We only had 1
             round. Shoot! When we came back, we read our books and then got ready
             for math. There at recess, I just wander and wander and wander and
             wandered around until the bell rang. Back at class we just improbed
             our neatness on math. We did 4 problems until lunch went by. Since it
             was lunch with the teacher day, some people stayed in the classroom
             for lunch. There at the cafeteria, I chose the beef hot dog. I just
             ate some and threw it away. Also at recess, I played UNO, expect I
             loss in a different way. Back at class, we contiuned math, and then
             planner and flipbooks. I didn't get to finish so I had to bring it
             home (O got it done). Then we cleaned up and packed up. We said
             goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich and that was our day!

             Wed 11/07/2018 
             --------------
             In the morning I did the usual: library. Of course I loved the
             library, and read and read and read and read and read and read until
             the bell rang. When we lined up a sub lead us to class instead of Mrs.
             Ennerich.  When we went into the classroom, we did the same, but with
             a sub and more noise. When it was group, they had to go and we read
             and read and read 2 stories, then our TO DO, and Typing Club. Most
             of us got it done, and soon we lined up for recess, expect not getting
             ready for math. Over there and recess, I did the usual: read and read
             and read and read and read and read and read and read and read until
             the bell rang. Back in class we did math and reviewed our homework,
             and soon we did the math test which had 5 questions. I think I got
             them all right. When we were done, we read until lunch came. There at
             lunch I chose the majority: Breakfast for Lunch. With hash browns or
             brown thingy? I choose the hash brown! As I ate peacefully (actually no
                     there was too much noise.) When we got dismissed for recess, I just
             did the usual: UNO. If your wondering about UNO, it's about cards. Not
             just any random Queen, Joker, of those cards. It's about you have to
             match number or color, but you also can play action cards. The colors
             are red, blue, yellow and green. After recess, my class and I went to
             the library (since it's Wednesday.) Over there at the library I just
             renewed some of my books and read for the rest of the time until we
             had to go. Back over there we read for 10 minutes until we did our
             planner and flip books. I was ALMOST Finished until we had to pack up
             and clean up. We did the usual stuff but MORE louder. And then we said
             goodbye to our sub, Mr. Forgary. That was my day!

             Tue 11/06/2018 
             --------------
             Today is Tuesday! I can't wait for the weekend! In the beginning I
             walked around until class started. We did the usual of the day,
             Unpack, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, and blah. Then we had
             to go to recess. When we went to the blacktop and the bell for the 3rd
             and 2nd grade, we went out. I just wandered around for recess, trust
             me. When we came back, we did math reviews, with some in the back. But
             as I soon finished, we had to go to lunch. Over there, I choosed the
             majorty: pepporni pizza. And I did the usual. After that, I played
             UNO for the rest of the time.  When we lined up for science, over
             there we did a project of brochures. We did those for 30 minutes then
             we had to go. Back at class we did our planner and also did Lipbooks
             until it was time for packing up and cleaning up. We all did those
             things until we stacked up, said goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich, and that
             was our day! I know I didn't have much lines as usual, but yeah, I
             hope you enjoy this entry!

             Mon 11/05/2018 
             --------------
             Today at school, I started going to the library, since it was open!
             (See Mon 29-Fri 2) But awhile then, 2 huskies went into the library.
             Some people, including me, had to go out of the library since the
             incident. When my class and I came in, we did the usual, until it was
             the Assembly! There, people got rewards, but it was only for 4th and
             5th grade. I got the 4.0 GPA, a.k.a Superintedent Award. My only
             classmate that got the same as me was Darina. After that we came back
             and did Theme about WONDER, the book we finished. Our theme was 'Don't
             judge a book by it's cover. Soon we had to go to recess. Over there, I
             just wandered around for recess. When we came back, we did some of
             Theme, and soon we did math. When we did math, we reviewed our
             homework, and reviewed our mat

             Sun 11/04/2018 
             --------------
             As we started the morning with some ACNL, we also  out the trash. Mom
             cooked Popcorn Chicken and it was for me! Me and Maxine also did the
             dishes too. The reason Maxine was doing that was she wanted to go to
             Barnes and Nobels, and she had to do it. We got ready for awhile, then
             went to Barnes and Nobels. We read for awhile, then played puppets for
             kids. When those kids left, Maxine, Andrew and I walked around for
             awhile while Dad was gone. Our first location was Body Beauty Wash,
             then Best Buy and finally got ice cream at our final location: Cold
             Stone Creamery. When Dad came back to pick us up and we got into the
             car, I ate the leftovers, we just went back and that was it! At home,
             we played Breath of the Wild. We found 2 shrines, and a new village!
             Also, we had a mini boss of the Yuga Team? I don't know, but then
             Maxine and I played Animal Crossing, and here I am, typing. I hope you
             enjoy this short entry!

             Sat 11/03/2018 
             --------------
             The weekend has just began! In the morning Maxine and I played ACNL,
             until the rest of us woke up. We putted bottles in the car to sell
             them. When Andrew and Dad left, I contiuned playing New Leaf, Maxine
             probably on the phone, and Mom doing landury. When Dad and Andrew came
             back, they got me a Vanilla Bean! After drinking some of it, Maxine,
             Mom and I went to sleep. When we woke up, Andrew, Maxine and I played
             The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Soon, Mom and Dad had to go
             so we said goodbye. I know this is a short day, but we hadn't done
             much. I hope you enjoy this short entry!

             Fri 11/02/2018 
             --------------
             Today at school was last miniuim day! We started our day with math,
             not NA Flipbooks. We did nothing new, but just reviewing. We did 1 -
             11, while some of us did 2 problems in different ways. The first
             group, including me, had the first one that was a tricky tricky! I
             hate that problem! But we did 2nd next, and I was the first one to
             finish! When I came back, there was a lot ahead of me! I finished the
             page though! Soon everybody talked, and we lost a dojo point. We read
             for awhile, then we contiuned math, and soon we did Flipbooks! I only
             finished 1 and our first: Maidu Tribe. I really suck at flipbooks.
             Soon we did our planners, packed up, and went to recess. Over at
             recess, I played with Harkiant and Katelyn, though I walked around for
             the rest of the time. When we came back, we contiuned Flipbooks, soon
             reading. We stacked our chairs after all of that, one team by one
             team. Then we got our treats, since it was Emily's birthday! After
             that, we went to lunch! I got the majorty! Then a cookie! I ate few,
             like usual. At recess, I played UNO with 1, then 3! Micheal won!
             When we came back, we got our backpacks, said goodbye to Mrs.
             Emmerich, and that was our day!

             Thu 11/01/2018 
             --------------
             Today after school(12:45) we went to Costco for Maxine's gorgla bars,
             since mom signend up for it. We also got some food + more food. When
             we were done, we went to Kaisers for me and Maxine's glasses. There,
             we tried out our new glasses and get a case, fabric, and that was it!
             We then go to the Hmong Super Market, where we just get Coconut juice
             and jello for Dillyn and Delyah. We were close to their house, so we
             just went there. We just did nothing at first, but then we did slime
             and BBC. We BBC some steak, and I ate lots of it. We played Ms. Fox,
             Red Light, Green Light, Freeze Tag, and others too! Mom and Andrew had
             to leave to go to Goodwill. We repeated those stuff until they came
             back. Dillyn and Delayh did their homework, and after hours we got to
             play GameCube? I don't know, but anyways, we had to go and that was
             our After School! At School we did the normal stuff, but after
             sharing, printing, and that stuff, we read and read and read and read,
             until we had to go take a break. We had to cut and glue the printed
             paper for the Native Americans. Some of us didn't finish. (I was one
                     of them) Then we read WONDER, and soon we started a new book: Island
             of the Blue Dophlin. Soon we had to go to recess. I just read and read
             and read and read like the usual. (See October 20-31) When we came
             back, we read our new story! We read and read and read and read and
             read, until we had to pack up, stack up, and line up for Lunch. We
             read the few pages of our new story, then we went to lunch. I went
             with the little people. At lunch recess, I just did nothing. And when
             we came back? We got our backpacks, said goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich, and
             that was our our day!

             Hi journal, todays Halloween! Anyways, when my class went in the
             classroom(haha get it?), we did the same, expect that we talked a lot
             about Halloween, which is today. We TRIED to print out our native
             americans, but the printer wouldn't JUST work! We soon gave up and
             went back into class. We reviewed some math, and some of us were the
             Math 'Tutors'. I was one of them and helped James, which was
             struggling with math. Our pratice(that I JUST finished) was 116 11-15.
             We packed up, stacked up, earlier than Tue and Mon because we had to
             go to science after recess.  As me and my class went to blacktop for
             recess, I just did the usual: READ and READ and READ and READ and READ
             and READ and READ and READ and READ and READ and READ and READ and
             READ and READ , and finally, read. When we came back from recess, we
             did the telegraph. 2 codes were STREAM, and the columms and rows.
             After 20 minutes we went to lunch. We went to a different path than
             usual. Mr. H let it go though. When we went to lunch, I went with the
             majorty + cookie! When everybody went out, I did the usual, tag. But
             we talked about Halloween. After lunch we went back into our usual
             class, get our backpacks, and said goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich. That was
             our day!

             Tue 10/30/2018 
             --------------
             Hello journal! Today was just like others. We did the usual as
             yesterday (Native Americans) because it was conferce week. A majorty
             of our class finished, including myself. We read WONDER until about a
             few minutes we got ready for math. As we lined up and went to the
             blacktop. As for recess, I just read and read and read and read and
             read and read. When our class came back, we learned what kids'
             parents knew what to do. That is the Digit by Digit. We did some
             reviewing about the Digit by Digit, a.k.a DMSB. Our pratice is 114
             with 5 problems to answer. Soon we did our planner, packing up,
             stacking up, and read WONDER till' lunch. We were almost done with the
             book, but it was time to go to lunch. As we lined up and went to
             lunch, there was no free seating, as I know (see Friday 25, October).
             We ate our lunch and went outside for recess. As usual, we played free
             tag but did line tag first. We were about to do 3v1 but time ran out,
             and we had to go to class in order to get our backpacks and say
             goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich. And that was my day! The reason why this is
             a short day because it is confrence week. But yeah it is acceptable.
             Bye!

             Mon 10/29/2018 
             --------------
             Yesterday(Sunday) we went to San Fransico, which is 2 hours long. When
             we wemt there, we talked about some stuff, but Andrew, Maxine and I
             went to sleep during driving. When I was the first to wake up, after 2
             mintues we were at San Fransico! I checked the time. It was about 2.
             Andrew and Maxine woke up also. We went to the "Fake" golden gate
             bridge, then the Silver Gate Bridge. Soon we went to the money
             thingly. And after paying, we were allowed to go to the real city.
             There, we read the shops and went to town to town. Then awhile we were
             at the Golden Gate Bridge. After 20 mintues, I got tired and we had to
             go back into the car. We also got to see the view of China Town. Then
             we left and go back home. Also, on today was a confernce week day,
             which means it short. Anyways, we did the normal stuff, expect that we
             did Social Studies earlier than we do. We did 2 rounds with final
             tribe. We also did chromebooks but putted them away. We went to recess
             after that. Of course, I did the usual: Read, Play, Read. When we came
             back, we did some reviewing of our math. Mrs. Emmerich was generous
             that day so we got soaring eagles and clip ups. We then did our
             planner, packed up, stacked chairs and read until it was time for
             lunch. We had Cheeseburgers and Chicken Taqutios. With a few minutes
             we losed 2 mintues of our recess + no free seating. But for awhile, my
             table stayed there while I went free. Yay! At lunch recess, we did the
             usual of course, and after recess and lunch we went back into class
             ,get our backpacks and said goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich. That was the
             last day and today!


             Fri 10/26/2018 
             --------------
             Wear Red Day! Yep, that was the day when we wear red!(I wore red and
                     white yarn so does that count? As we did the usual, also I told you
                     that we had groups on Friday, but only four people left, and we read
                     our story, The Fisherman and the Kaha Bird. We did some questions and
                     make some as well. Then we lined up for recess. As of course, I read
                     Book 11 of Wings Of Fire. When we came back, we reviewed our Place
                     Value divison. But after about 2 reviews, we had to go to lunch. It
                     was free seating, but I sat at my table with the majorty choice(it was
                         terribe) and when I was done, we wasted 5 minutes of our recess, and
                     there was no free seating next week and I mean ALL Week. When we were
                     excuesed to go outside, we did the same thing: Cops And Robbers. We
                     were probably going to do blue shoe. Then after recess we did a
                     pledge/oath with a sticker. Soon we got lollipops with the sticker
                     too. Mrs. Emmerich read to us before we contiuned math. When we
                     contiuned math we learned the 2nd way to do divison: Expand Notation
                     Method. Then we praticed the Place Value method again. Soon we did our
                     planner. We had a unusual math pratice: 1, Place Value, 2 & 3,
                     Expanison Method. And the rest? As the usual. We did our Native
                     Americans Shasta Tribe, docs and writing. Then, we packed up, and
                     cleaned up as usual. Also, Mrs. Emmerich metioned next week with be
                     shorter days for the meetings and that stuff, with the library being
             closed all week too. Then we said goodbye and that was our day. 

             Tue 10/23/2018 
             --------------
             Today was such a wacky day. At the first 15 minutes of class we had a
             guest teacher that would test how well is the school's students
             behavior doing. After awhile Mrs. Emmerich came back. Did I also
             metion we did math earlier than we usually do? Yes, it was whiteboard
             though. When we were done with our whiteboard 'review', we went to
             recess. At recess, I just played Cops/Robbers with Max, Lillie, Tracy,
             and another girl. In class, we contiuned math, and learned a new
             thing: remainders and divison. We also learned about a remainder can't
             be higher than the divider. And after 2 questions, we did on rest on
             our own. For about 10 minutes, we had to go to lunch. I had beef
             tacos, although I gave them to Aiden, which is in our class. At
             recess, I just played on the playgroud. Which is also a waste of time
             I could had. In science class, we had a better day than last's week of
             Tuesday. After coming back to class, we did our planner, then the
             guest teacher back to read for us. Then she said goodbye to us. And
             that our day! And here are things I DIDN'T metion: Austin was in a bad
             mood and was angry with everybody. Today was crazy hair day. I AM
             still friends with my old groups. I played with one of them today.
             Reminder: Cash/Credit for harvest festival/field trip. Whiteboards
             were on our desks in the first step. And at home we ate about most of
             the whipped cream. Found my hospital card. Finally, here typing.
             Thanks for reading my journal!

             Sat 10/20/2018 
             --------------
             Today was my doctor appointment. We started off our day with getting
             ready. Also, my mother had to wake up dad of course. We got in the
             car. During driving, my mom and dad talked, including me. When we got
             there, we did height and stuff. Then we waited about 30 minutes in a
             room. Then we met Dr. Tom. He said the vaseline will help me. When we
             came into the medicine room, we just ordered for some things and then
             we went to the South Area. We shopped over there, nothing special. We
             came back home. I made candy sushi with Maxine and Andrew, which was a
             total fail, yes me and Maxine gave it a 1 star. When Maxine was
             asleep, Andrew and I went walking around our school. After coming
             home, Maxine woke up, Mom was home and we went to Goodwill for about 1
             hour, then CVS for Mom's lottery. Then came back home. Maxine, Andrew
             and Dad went to Barnes and Nobels, also Jamba Juice, while me and Mom
             stayed home for 3 hours. They came home awhile ago, and that was my
             day! I'm very sorry for not writing about 23 lines, but not much
             happenend today. So I'm here on the 18 line, typing extra things I did
             not metion during this day. Andrew and I went to the park, during a
             party, not to metion. I played tag with younger people at the park. We
             found obibsan and a slinky. For the last few minutes of Goodwill, we
             did tops/Beyblade. Also got some soda. CVS Halloween stuff, plus
             beauty section. And finally, during 3 hours, I danced, ate, and for
             the minutes of them coming home, played Roblox. Not to metion the rash
             is getting better! And here I am, 25 lines, longer than I expected,
             not to mention on 26 now. I hope this day was better than the others I
             wrote about, plus the extra things I metioned. That was all today!

             Tue 10/16/2018 
             --------------
             Today we had a very bad day. First our class did the regular daily
             basis. But in reading Jerime was great behavior at reading. While the
             remainers(me) did Main Idea and Key Details. After that we presented
             our Main Idea and Key Details. Then it was recess. I just read for
             that recess.  When we headed back, we did our review of our math test
             and what was going to happen in the math test. We did about 1-7
             (skipping 4). Then Mr. Higgibottom came to get the notebooks. We also
             had to go to lunch. I got chicken nuggets. When we came out, I just
             raced with other people, wandered around, waiting for the odd group,
             but probably they went back into the classroom. After lunch and
             recess, we went into science. Dang, that place was a bad day! When we
             came in, we were just having a normal day, until Mr. Higgibottom said
             he would be now on letting us just write. But he gave us a second
             chance. We still had a bad day.  When we came back, Mrs. Emmerich was
             serious still has like Mr.  Higgibottom. We contiuned the day. After
             realizing we couldn't finish, we just did our planner. Then Mrs.
             Emmerich explained about Jeremire.  About his behavior and he needs
             help or something like that. Yeah, that didn't help our day. But yeah,
             we packed up. I was one of the people to clip up also. Anyways, we
             said goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich. Then I headed to the library. After
             staying for awhile, I went out with my sister to head home and that
             was it! 

             Mon 10/15/2018 
             --------------
             Today is the first day of the week! Before our day started, we had a
             late morning, but anyways, we came after the bell rang, so lucky,
             right? But after doing our morning stuff, we made flash cards, since
             tomorrow is vocab test. And I wasn't lucky enough to finish. But when
             we took a online EADMS test, I finished the test! Also, after
             finishing, I finished my flash cards and read for the rest of our free
             time. When it was about time for recess, we got ready for math and
             lined up to recess. Then when we arrived at the blacktop, I got a
             snack so I went to the green bench + green table. After finishing my
             snack, I played with Silas for the rest of the recess. Back at class,
             we did math. Of our pratice with skipping a few lessons. One of the
             examples our equations were: 6508x2. After that, we did our
             planner(since it was early day), expect we wrote vocab quiz. Why?
             Because, you remember. I said vocab quiz would be tomorrow, right?
             Then we lined up for lunch. The choices were Cheeseburger/Chicken
             Taquito. I went with the majorty. After eating, we went to play. I
             just played with Austin for the whole recess. When we came back to
             class, we read Kids in Business. Meanwhile reading, we took turns
             getting to read a short text. I got halfway through. When we finished
             reading, we packed up, cleaned up our desks, help clean the
             classroom, we see the 3 people who got a good grade. I was one of
             them. After that we said goodbye, and went home. That was our day!

             Fri 10/12/2018 
             --------------
             Today at 8:30 we were greeted this morning by Mr. G, not Mrs.
             Emmerich. Anyways, after unpacking and reading 5 extra minutes, we did
             our Native Americans test. After about 15 minutes Mrs. Emmerich came
             back. She asked Mr. G about our behavior. After that we contiuned our
             test for 10 more minutes and then we turned it in. We did our groups
             then. We did our reading pratice. I got 193 word at the 3rd read. My
             partner was Edik. Soon after our 3rd read we prepared for math. We
             lined up for recess, and waited for group come back. When the line was
             all together, we went to recess. When we were at near the blacktop,
             Ms. Cathy excused us to recess. I just read for that recess. When we
             went back to class, the whole afternoon Mrs. Emmerich told us Mrs.
             Smith would be our sub. When she left, the first thing we did was Mrs.
             Smith is math. We reviewed our math homework, then we did our new math
             skill, estimate and exact. After doing our work, Mrs. Smith let us
             line up and go to lunch. I choose the majorty choice of our lunch. The
             fish sticks weren't that good that day. When we went to recess. I just
             played helicopter. Then after lunch we read WONDER, and contiuned
             math. After math, we did our new tribe: Shasta. They were the mountian
             tribe, from what I can tell. Soon, we did our planner, packed up, and
             doing good that day, Mrs. Smith told us we could do GoNoodle. The
             activies we did was Milkshake and Freeze Dance. Then we stacked our
             chairs and said goodbye. That was our day!


             Thu 10/04/2018 
             --------------
             Yesterday(Wens.), we had a sub because Mrs. Emmerich had to go to a
             meeting at Auburn. When we went to class, we saw teams. That was for
             points. Mrs. D intertuced herself while we were unpacking. When we
             were done she did our morning call, lunch count, and then we did
             reading. There was no PE, we did our skill which we of Cause and
             Effect. Then we did our grammar test. We tried doing a GoNoodle but it
             didn't work so she owned us 2 more GoNoodles at the end of the day. We
             prepared for math and lined up for recess. I didn't do that much of
             the recess. I just sharpen crayons with Katelyn and E. We also find
             crayons(from last year) but we also lost 1. It was a sad day or Kate.
             When we came back we did a hangman(2 rounds) and then we did our work.
             After that we did another round of hangman. That's when we also lined
             up and went to lunch. The lunch choice was chicken patty/chicken.
             After eating, it was raining, but only for awhile. After that Mrs. Net
             said that we had to do a walk and talk. Most of us were dispointed.
             While we were walking and talking, I talked to Harkiant. When Harkiant
             talked to Kate she went to the bathroom. I don't know why but I
             followed her. After that we were able to play at the playground (but
                     we could still do the walk and talk). After recess, we went back to
             our classroom. When Mrs. D told us we would be doing our paragraph, we
             did it with her. Cause, you know, you can't do it alone, can't you?
             But after that packed, not stacked up. Then we did a couple rounds of
             hangman, read WONDER, did Heads Up 7 Up. After that we stacked up and
             said goodbye to Mrs.  D. That was my day! 

             Mon 10/01/2018 
             --------------
             Today is the 1st day of the Book Fair! But for me, I went to the
             walking wilderness. After getting freshed up, we lined up and did that
             same thing, expect after our math and stuff, we read the whole story
             of motion. Their genre was "Narrative Non-Ficton", then we lined up
             for PE. We did our normal 2 laps, but there were 3 classes, so we did
             3 activies, 1: Cars, 2: Run and Back, and 3: Loop Rock Paper Scissors
             Shot. We jump through hoop to hoop in legs jump. If we get close we do
             Rock Paper Scissors. That's for you if you don't know it. But after
             PE, we contiuned our story, when we finished, we prepared for math,
             and lined up. The people with money went to the book fair, and the
             rest of us went to the playground. Katelyn, Harkiant and Eliana were
             sharping Crayons. Harkiant was moody today. She yelled at Kate and
             Eliana after recess. When we came back for math(my class) we learned
             the 4th way of our 3 methods, we pratice with it. On notebooks and
             pratice, we learned the 4th way of the methods. Then we did planner on
             math, lined up, and went to lunch. Today was 'Grandparents' day, so
             some people had picnics. The rest of us? Just a normal lunch. When it
             was recess, I just strolled around for recess. Actually, nah. I played
             with Harkiant. She was in a better mood around that time. After
             recess/lunch, it was suprising we didn't went to the reading lounge!
             We just went in, did our planner, and got on our chromebooks. We wrote
             our paragraph of the Maidu Tribe, after that we packed up, get our
             treat from footballs, and read WONDER. Then we lined up and sat down.
             When the bell rang we said goodbye and went home, that was our day! 

             Wed 09/26/2018 
             --------------
             Today we unpacked, do our folders, and that, but when we did our math
             homework, I and other classmates got a soaring eagle, because us did
             our homework on binder paper, but anyways, we did our reading, and
             groups, we did to-dos. And then we read in our big books. Soon Mrs.
             Emmerich asked us a favor, it was to help others and us get ready for
             math. We did everything we could, and then we got a dojo point. Soon
             we lined up and Mrs. Emmerich told us her job would be easy if we did
             this everyday. Most of the group kids didn't came back(like this
                     morning), so we went off to the playground. When we went to the
             playground most of the group kids came back, but they didn't say we
             left them out like this morning. I played with Silas and my sister on
             1st recess, after recess, we learned 2 methods of how to do area
             models, we learned the 2nd today. It was expansion noting something?
             But anyways we did it on the notebooks and the whiteboards, we also
             got the advantage to draw. After that, we prepared for library, so
             after that we lined up. The lunch was so delicous for today's menu!
             And after that I just played state tag for that recess. When we lined
             up, Noah/Emily were talking about their problems. Emily: Friend
             Betrayal, Noah: Unfinished Sunbathing. Soon, when we went to class, we
             get our library books, and headed to the library. When we were there,
             Mrs. Heller told us about the book fair and that the normal library
             will be closed. Then she read us Tornado, a 3rd grade level book.
             After that we checked out books, lined up, and went back to class. We
             did our planner, grammar, and Maidu writing. Soon after that we packed
             up, read WONDER, said goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich and off we went. And
             that was my day!  

             Mon 09/24/2018 
             --------------
             Today, at class, we unpacked and blah blah blah, then we went to PE.
             It was all 3 classes today. After running 2 laps, 1-15 went driving
             cars, and 16-29 went doing the same thing. And 3rd class went running
             2 laps again. Soon after that we lined up and went back to class. Over
             at class, we read WONDER, then we did our essintal question, and did
             our vocab chart. At the middle of the vocab chart, we did a brain
             break, soon we contiuned our vocab chart, when we were done, we
             prepared for reveiwing our homework, and most of us were caught. I
             wasn't one of them though! At recess, I don't remembered what I did
             though. After recess, we corrected our homework and did more noting
             than activies. But anyways, we got our pratice tonight, and lined up
             for lunch and lunch recess. I got my lunch, ate it, lined up and blah
             blah blah, and went outside. I am not going to tell you what happenend
             at lunch recess, but it was diferent anyway. After lunch recess, we
             lined up for class. Soon for that we did our planner, get our library
             books, and headed for the reading lounge. Matthew was with us. We said
             Hi and then headed in the Reading Lounge. 16-29 was first. Then our
             line. I sat next to Matthew, lucky me! In awhile of reading, we did
             Statest of the Class. We stayed there for about 30 minutes. Soon we
             came back to our class, and packed up. Then we read, watched the
             broadcast, stacked up and sat down, and said goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich.
             That was my day! But after school was 'over,' I guess I 'goofed'
             around. But anyways, that was it!

             Sun 09/23/2018 
             --------------
             At 6:00 AM today, I woke up, but I went back to sleep. At 8:00 AM, we
             cleaned the house, well, not the WHOLE house, but just the living
             room, and we also did landury. At 11:00/12:00 AM/PM, we were going to
             Delayh's house. Yay! But also we stopped for McDonalds too! We got, 2
             Large Fries, 20 Chicken Nuggets, and 2 Big Macs. Then we headed for
             Delyah's house. First, we talked and played, we also used our devices.
             Then mom and Andrew went to South Area. We played school and then
             slime. Aunt Moua went to sleep with Dallas too. When we played school,
             I was first teacher's assitant, Daisy a student, Delyah a teacher,
             Maxine CO-Princpal, and Dillyn, princpal. Daisy was soon out of the
             game, I changed to a student, Maxine a student, and Delyah/Dillyn
             still the same. I did a good job being a student, and Daisy was soon
             back in the game, but out of the game for crying. Then we did a
             "projECt." And soon we did "Games" school, we soon played slime, I
             soon made a monster out of my slime! Ooo spooky! We then tested out MY
             slime with squishes, soap, and other stuff. Then Aunt Moua came back,
             and Dallas was awake. Dallas went outside, and we still got in trouble
             for the slime. Then it was 6:00 PM and we were worried about Mom and
             Andrew. Sooner or later, we used our IPads. And then we got cookies,
             did massages, and all of that, soon Maxine had enough and called mom.
             Then minutes later and soon they came back, they also got treats too.
             Nom Nom Nom! Then we went home and that was our day! C: (Expect I'm
                     home typing this right now)

             Sat 09/22/2018 
             -------------- 
             On Friday, I gave a drawing(note) to Harkiant, she is a black person,
             and a friend of mine. I told her to give it to Katelyn on 1st recess.
             That was before class, so at class, we did our Skills Test(Harkiant
                     was at science). After that, Mrs.  Emmerich explained that after
             recess, we were going to have a sub for the rest of the day(like on
                     Thursday). So, at recess, Katelyn thanked me for giving her the
             drawing. We just played tag after giving up finding Sus. After recess,
             we lined up, and went to the classroom, finding a sub in our class.
             Mrs. Emmerich explained that our sub is Ms. May. We contiuned math,
             and then we did our homework (like Mr Dier at 3rd/2nd Grade). Soon we
             lined up and headed for the cafeteria. This time, the lunch was set up
             in plastic bowls. Then we lined up for recess. Alot of people were too
             busy playing in the NED Zone.  So I just sit down for the rest of the
             recess. After recesss we read a bit of WONDER, then we did language
             arts. Ms. May was a good artist, and people were getting a little
             nosy(but we were able to get through that).  After that, we did our
             planner, and Zayne's birthday, we packed and blah blah blah, we said
             goodbye to Ms. May. But before I went home with my sister, I went to
             the library, thinking 'Should I get a new book?' But soon I was caught
             by my sister, and I had to rush. But I didn't get a new book all in
             all. That was Friday on this week. C:

             Wed 09/19/2018 
             --------------
             Today's morning we unpacked, and did our same old day. Our lunch
             choices were Teryaki Chicken, and Patty Sandwich. I went with the
             less. Then we did reading/grammar. After that we prepared for math and
             read WONDER, and then lined up for recess. Also, we got a temporary
             sub. At recess we played with Suos on the playground. We also got
             'bitten' too.  I also brought my library book, but I didn't have
             enough time to read it. After recess we did math. We contiuned arrays
             and bunny hops. We prepared for library too. Then we lined up for
             lunch. There I didn't eat anything but my apple. Joy ate my drumstick
             too. After we were released(we were the last), we waited until Suos
             was there again. We had to get off of the playground and go to the
             grass. That didn't stopped us from playing. We still got chased at one
             point or another, but yeah. After lining up for library, we get our
             library books and went to the library. Instead of reading the story,
             Mrs. Heller told us about the Book Fair and we watched what was going
             to be at the Book Fair for us.  Then we checked out books and read.
             After awhile we lined up and went back to class and did our planner.
             Soon we did Social Studies vocab and next, Mrs. Emmerich explained the
             wesnday folders' insides.  Then we packed up. We also cleaned the
             room, or I say, the enviorment.  After that we read WONDER again. Soon
             we stacked up, lined up, sit down, and waited until the bell rang.
             Phew, there was more details, but let's say I'll be saying those in
             extras of our bottom in this journal.

             Sat 09/15/2018 
             --------------
             When school(not classes) started, I went to the library. Then it was
             classes. We started the day off by putting our money in our
             backpacks(since it's the NED show) , getting our homework out, and we
             did our lunch count. Our lunch choices were Fish Sticks or Cheese
             Encildas. There were more students that choosed Fish Sticks than Cheese
             Encildas. I went with majority. Then we did reading. We reread
             Earthquakes. It was about tsumais and earthquakes. We also watched
             news of hurricane Florence. But it died down so it was called a
             tropical storm. Then we wrote the difference of tsumais and
             earthquakes. Then we did grammar. Only SOME of the grammar. We do 1
             page a day, so then after that we prepared for math. We needed a
             grass. That didn't stopped us from playing. We still got chased at one
             point or another, but yeah. After lining up for library, we get our
             library books and went to the library. Instead of reading the story,

             notebook, activiy book, a array paper, and pencil. Then we lined up
             for recess. So we zipped up, quieted our mouths, and walked to the
             playground. We got there early so we waited until the 2nd and 3rd
             graders left and lined up. We were excused for recess so we played
             around. Suese wasn't there, so we just played on the playground. After
             recess we went back for class. We learned about arrays. We got our
             homework assignment, and it was time for lunch, again we lined up and
             went to lunch. I also got a cookie. After eating for lunch we lined
             up(we were the last class), and went outside for recess. I just went
             to the playground and played with my friends. Then after lunch, we did
             our planner, we packed up, left our bags, and went to the NED show.
             There at the NED show he told us a story of Ned's morning, what to do
             to master something, and then it was done! After that we stacked our
             chairs, sit dowm, and waited until school was done. When school was
             done I went home with Maxine. 

             Thu 09/13/2018

             Today at school we had a math test. But before that we went to class,
             we unpacked, got our homework, lunch count, and then we did reading
             and writing! Our new story was earthquake. It was about earthquakes
             and tsumais. Then we wrote on our notebooks. Then it was PE for me and
             others, the rest went to groups. We did our lap test. I passed. There
             was 50 seconds left when I finished. I accdently left my library book
             there so we picked it up when we came back. We earned a spray. We
             prepared for math test, and then we read Wonder. It was then recess,
             so I went to the playground. There was a person called 'Suse' and he
             bites people. So I stayed away from him after recess. We did our math
             test, and we were able to finish it (well some of us), then we went to
             lunch. I got beef hot dog, and we were the last table to go to the
             line. We did the same thing as last recess. After that it was science.
             We learned about wires, lightbulbs, and battery. Then we went back to
             class to contiune our math test. If we were done, we could read
             Earthquakes. Then we did our grammar. We learned about nor. Then we
             packed up, did our planner, and read Wonder again. Then when the bell
             rang we stacked our chairs, lined up, and left. I had to leave so I
             get my prize tomorrow so I went to the library. Sooner or later I
             finsihed the book. Then I checked out before we left.

             --------------
             Today we went to school. I forgot my math homework so I got a bench
             pass. We did our grammar and reading. We read a new story and a new
             comp skill: reread. We read 'Changing the world' We had questions. And
             then we did a grammar page. We only did a few of it. Then it was math.
             We did math review. We did half of the equations but stopped. It was
             recess. I got bench so I did my work and sit down. I finished it when
             it was time to line up. After that we continue our grammar packet.
             When we were done we did our math review. Soon it was lunch. We lined
             up and walked to lunch. We had 2 choices: Beef Taco, or Cheese pizza.
             I choosed Cheese Pizza. Then it was recess. I did nothing and just
             clinged to bars. Then it was science. We did postive and negative
             charges. We also note it on the chrome/notebooks. Then we watched a
             video. It was short. After that our science teacher told Mrs. Emmerich
             we had a good day. We got a dojo. I forgot about something I didn't
             talked about lunch: alot of us expect me and some others didn't leave
             the room. We got a clip up. And the others got a clip down. Then we do
             our planner. Soon after that we finished the grammar page and do our

             On Friday we took a online test, and a math test. But before that we
             unpack our homework, and some fund raiser coupons. We had 2 lunch
             choices: Mac and Cheese, or Fish Sticks. I choosed fish sticks. But
             there were more people that chose mac and cheese. After that we got
             the results for our grammar test. I got an A+ with 100% correct. We
             did our online test(idioms Ex: Girl, that robber is stealing, don't
                     help him and add fuel to the fire!) I missed most of the test, but I
             got to catch up and finish. My grade was 90%. After that it was
             recess. I played with Silas, then Hakirat. After that we went back to
             class for a math test. We had 8 minutes before lunch. I was on the 3rd
             problem until Mrs. Emmerich interrupted us. We had to go to lunch. We
             lined up, zipped up, and walked to lunch. We had our food, plus a
             cookie and a juice box. I ate the cookie, fish sticks, and drank my
             juice box. After that we went to recess. I just did nothing and
             walked around the area. After that we came back and contiuned our
             tests. Mrs. Emmerich peeked around us and pointed our mistakes on the
             test. We knew she was helping for us to understand what we did wrong.
             I got one mistake on the last question, I didn't add the total
             numbers correctly. After that we studied Language Arts. We learned
             about where the Local Native Indians' houses and location. Soon when
             we learned about them we pack up, stack up, and collect trash. Then we
             sat down for reading Wonder. We ended on a page before a chapter.
             After that we said goodbye to Mrs. Emmerich and school was dismissed. 

             9/3/2018
             On Thursday we had a scince test. But before that we had that test we
             unpacked, and did reading/language arts. We wrote notes and did some
             grammar. After that we did our early homework planner. It was recess
             and I played with my friends. After that we did some subtracting on
             the whiteboard. We also got to draw. After that it was lunch! I got
             beef hotdog. After eating we  It was science. The test! We had 9
             questions, but we had short time for reading. Then we do our classroom
             on the chromebooks. We went back to class for the math and planner, we
             packed up, and school was over! Okay I finshed the homework finally!

             9/2/2018
             Today was great. I went with mom to get some Yao. After that we tried
             to wait at the shaved ice but we stopped waiting and thought the
             workers overslept. We went to BamBu to get Mom's drink. Then we went
             to get my in-and-out. We got 3 fries(Maxine and Andrew ate it all), 2
             cheeseburgers, and a Vanilla shake for me. After getting our order we
             go to Goodwill. We stayed there for about 2 hours. Then we went to
             SafeWay. We went to get our watermelon, milk, and cupcake supplies.

             And I still hadn't broke the habit of signing the signture. Anyways,
             we walked to school always, but when we started at line, we had a
             backpack mystery and a new student. Mrs. Emmerich told us to make the
             new student feel at home while she invested the Backpack mystery. The
             backpack mystery happenend at line because Juilo didn't have a
             backpack, when we had it, it was somebody from a different class.
             After that we did all of that, we unpacked, and did our lunch count,

             lose one if we didn't.  Then we watches Mystery Doug. We did the
             question after recess.And , it was hot out  there!
