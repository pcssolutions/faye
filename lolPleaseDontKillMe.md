## Remake of the Crystal's Heart (this time proper grammar and no messin around)
Episode One, Magic is in the Air. 

    Kikker transforms into Fire Kikker. "No!" said Zuri as she hugged Kikker.
    They both fuse and become Moonstone. Moonstone is now confused. Kikker sees
    her gems and Zuri. Then, Kirby, Tiff, and Tuff bump into Moonstone. Tiff is
    now also confused. Tiff says, "Who are you?" Moonstone repiles with, "I'm.."
    She blushes and then Kikker's eyes then turn Powder, or light, blue. "Uh, we
    fused.." said Moonstone. Then, King Dedede came in. "Another Puffball!" he
    said, and then he hitted Moonstone with his grand' hammer! Then, Moonstone
    unfused back into Zuri and Kikker. 

Information about Moonstone, Zuri, and Kikker. 

    Moonstone is the fusion of Zuri and Kikker. She is funny and nice, or you
    can say, humorous and kind. Her puffball color is purple, her weapons are
    the void, or unknown to say. Her friends are, Kirby, Tuff, Tiff, and Meta
    Knight. Zuri is orange, she is very silly, or said, foolish. Kikker is light
    blue, and has three gems. One is on her forehead, one on her left nubby, and
    one on her right nubby.
