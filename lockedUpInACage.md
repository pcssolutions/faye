## As Powerful I Can Be. Lyrics by Faye Ly. Written on June 11th, 2019.

**Music**

    Here we are,
    Aren't you afar
    from, my talent?
    Your no match,
    I'll win with
    no scratch
    of any kind.

    Will you rethink in your mind?
    That I'll win,
    You'll won't.
    So give up,
    And flee.
    Don't even try,
    you'll die,
    in, the end. 

    As Powerful I can be,
    I see you won't flee,
    ha, fool!
    I'll turn you to a puppet,
    and make you a tool!
    That's how as powerful,
    I can be!

**Music**

    As powerful as I can be!
    As, powerful, I can be!

## Let's play a game. Lyrics by Faye Ly. Written on June 11, 2019

    Let's play a game, game!
    Let's have fun today!
    I'm so bored, bored,
    In this place.
    For a long time, time,
    I've felt I spent here for my whole life, life,
    It may not be that, that,
    But maybe it is.

    Balance on balls, ball!
    We'll have fun, fun.
    Its been so long, long,
    since I've played a game.
    Let's play a game, game!
    And have fun, today today!

    I don't deserve your happy ending.

    It's true, don't deny.

    I'm too much to take care of.

    So have that ending, it's true.

    I don't deserve your happy ending.

    If you think I do, then you're wrong.

    You can't deny it, you can't fight it.

    No matter what you do.

    Goodbye you too!

    Goodbye to you.

    I'll miss you, it's true.

    But you should 
    
    But you should.

    Have

    That

    Happy

    Ending...

    I don't deserve your happy ending. 

    It's true, don't deny.

    You can't deny it, you can't fight it.

    No matter what you do.

    No matter what you do.

    Just take your happy ending~

    It's yours,

    It's yours,

    Forever and truly.

## I'm Somebody! By Faye Ly. Written on June 28, 2019

    I may not be male,
   

   or a female.

   But bullying me isn't

   **RIGHT**!

   Why you should

   bully me when I could

   bully **YOU** instead?

   I'm genderfluid.

   And I'm smart!

   But even though

   that can't be a reason.

   But I do what's right!

   No matter if you pick up a fight!

   Because I won't do it.

   If you challenge me,

   I'll tell on you, you'll see!

   That you'll that I'm at least

   **SOMEBODY**

   That'll teach you I'm 

   **SOMEBODY**


   I may not be male,

   or female.

   And I'm 'low' tier, but bullying is

   **WRONG**

   I don't care what you say.

   We can and will make you pay!

   What you did to us was wrong.

   And at least I'm 

   **SOMEBODY**

   Woah woah woah...

    : . . Music .. :

    What's wrong?

    You're mad?

    Hah! That's pretty bad!

    But at least you got your punishment.

    Bullying is wrong,

    I'll teach you with Opal along!

    Maybe you'll stop being rude to us.

    At least we're 

    SOMEBODIES

    At least 

    we

    are

    SOMEBODIES!

## Rewrite 3 of ESP's song or should I say, Psy? By Faye Ly, made on July 15th.

    My parents were controlling,

    What I should have been,

    They even took my doll,

    and force me things I didn't want.

    I wanted to see,

    that others cannot see,

    and do things that normal can't do.

    But they want me,

    to do things I cannot be.

    Fancy and Rich, is not destiny.

    Never was my destiny.

    They never let me, have any friends,

    To come by and I was never let outside.

    They took my doll from me. 

    They were the worst, you see.

    I'll never forgive them.

    There was a voice,

    to submit, and give up.

    I denied, until I SNAPPED.

    I brainwashed and destroyed,

    many homes, of the innocent.

    I cannot come back where I was,

    A kind, shy, and fragile Psy.

    But I'm getting ahead of myself here...

    There is something that I want, to talk about here (about here),

    That something, I want you to know... (Want you to know)

    And that is what I want is 

    BEAM.

    Beam is my doll.

    My parents took away her from me.

    Hammer is stopping me.

    He'll get away from here, you'll see. (you'll see)

    I guess that's enough, goodbye, dumb one.

    Farewell, gurantee...

*aaaaaa so cringey ;w; why am i so bad at making songs for ESP?? >:V 
Thank you to Nintendo, HAL, and Icestar for this series and Kirby. :D*
