	Peng: "Hey guys, Valetines Day is coming soon, what should we do? :D "
	Fubuki: "Candy? I can't see and that means we can't do cards, but I can still hear and taste."
	Jace: "I agree with Fubuki, we can't do cards for him, but we can still do candies!"
	Pastel: "I don't eat candy, and cards would be better. Who cares about Fubuki's needs? We can get him
	candy on his birthday."

Jace inhaled Waddle Everdee(somehow), and got his Mic Ablity. He then put up his microphone to his mouth close to
Pastel

	Jace: "Pastel, you litteraly will piss me off if you say another word. Peng! Get Fubuki and you out of here
	!"
	Pastel: "I'm not scared of yo-"

Peng and Fubuki ran and ran. Pastel was interrupted by Jace as he screeched 3 times. After that, she fainted. 
Peng openend the door with horror. Fubuki looked confused. 

	Peng: "Uh guys, we need to get a idea for Valentines Day, we can't just fight all day!"
	Jace: "Candy?"

In the end, they all decided getting ice cream and candy. As for Pastel, she had to miss out on that day.

	Peng: "The end!"
	Random young kirbys: "Aww, ok ya!"

The End <3
