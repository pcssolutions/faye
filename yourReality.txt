An Sad End # 1 

Goodbye to a world.

It may be painful, they said.

Yet I will still smile. 

Tears roll as I cry. 

Softly without any sound.

Please, don't blame yourself.

Sometimes we may fall,

(as) loss can bring depressed feelings.

(and) what I say (probably) is true.

Love never last forever. # 2

I'm (just) falling in love,

I (just) so wish to touch (your warm) colors.

(Just,) please don't let it end. 

(I) to cry is not weak.

I('ll) so wish to touch (those) colors.

(And end and) greet it with a smile.

Pain pain pain # 3

Tears (will just) roll as I cry,

(but) it comes very softly (at) first,

(And then, all the pain will come back for fun),

yet( , no matter what) I will still smile (just for fun). 

Don't be scared to fall (into death),

(but) it may be painful, they said.

(and) what I say is true.

Happy Sunshine. # 4

The world may trick us (into this is peaceful),

(but just) open your eyes to (true color),

(but still, you and )I still saw her smile. 

I (will) so wish to touch colors.

(And) yet I will (always) still smile.
